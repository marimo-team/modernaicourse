This is a companion repo to [Intro to Modern AI](https://modernaicourse.org), a
free online class by [CMU professor Zico Kolter](https://zicokolter.com/) that
teaches you how to train your own LLM from scratch using PyTorch — no prior
experience with machine learning or AI required.

In this repo, you will find:

- [`concepts/`](/concepts/): interactive marimo notebooks
that illustrate key concepts from lecture videos, with code
- [`homework/`](/homework/): an archive of homework notebooks that test your
understanding of the material and ultimately work up to training
your own LLM
- links to supplemental YouTube videos from [marimo's channel](https://youtube.com/@marimo-team/videos).

You can run notebooks online with [molab](https://molab.marimo.io/notebooks),
or locally with the [marimo library](https://docs.marimo.io).

## Concepts

Each concept notebook is associated with a lecture.

| Lecture | Notebook | Get started on molab |

## About the course

Intro to Modern AI is a course by CMU professor Zico Kolter. From the [course
website](https://modernaicourse.org/):

> This course provides an introduction to how modern AI systems work. By
> “modern AI”, we specifically mean the machine learning methods and large
> language models (LLMs) behind systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
> Despite their seemingly amazing generality, the basic techniques that
> underlie these AI models are surprisingly simple: a minimal LLM
> implementation leverages a fairly small set of machine learning methods and
> architectures, and can be written in a few hundred lines of code.
>
> This course will guide you through the basic methods that will let you
> implement a basic AI chatbot. You will learn the basics of supervised machine
> learning, large language models, and post-training. By the end of the course
> you will be able to write the code that runs an open source LLM from scratch,
> as well as train these models based upon a corpus of data.
