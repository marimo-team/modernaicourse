This is a companion repo to [Intro to Modern AI](https://modernaicourse.org), a
free online class by CMU professor Zico Kolter that teaches you how to train
your own LLM from scratch using PyTorch, starting from the basics of machine learning.

In this repo, you will find:

- `concepts/`: interactive marimo notebooks
that illustrate key concepts from lecture videos, with code
- `homework/`: an archive of homework notebooks that test your
understanding of the material and ultimately work up to training
your own LLM

On this `README.md`, we also link to supplemental YouTube videos from the
[marimo YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@marimo-team/videos).

You can run notebooks online with [molab](https://molab.marimo.io/notebooks),
or locally with the [marimo library](https://docs.marimo.io).

## About the course

Intro to Modern AI is a course by CMU professor Zico Kolter. From the [course
website](https://modernaicourse.org/):

> This course provides an introduction to how modern AI systems work. By
> “modern AI”, we specifically mean the machine learning methods and large
> language models (LLMs) behind systems like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Claude.
> Despite their seemingly amazing generality, the basic techniques that
> underlie these AI models are surprisingly simple: a minimal LLM
> implementation leverages a fairly small set of machine learning methods and
> architectures, and can be written in a few hundred lines of code.
>
> This course will guide you through the basic methods that will let you
> implement a basic AI chatbot. You will learn the basics of supervised machine
> learning, large language models, and post-training. By the end of the course
> you will be able to write the code that runs an open source LLM from scratch,
> as well as train these models based upon a corpus of data.
