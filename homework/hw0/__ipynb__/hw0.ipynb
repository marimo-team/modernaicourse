Most autograding systems work by uploading your code and running it on the grading server; this ensures that your code runs independently and functions as desired, but has the notable downside that, for complex assignments, it can be difficult to ensure that the environment of the autograder is sufficiently similar to your own environment.  Countless hours have been wasted by students trying to trace the exact way in which the autograding environment differs from their own.

    "As the first \"real\" problem of this assignment, you'll have to write a simple routine to compute prime numbers.  You will specifically do this using a method called the [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes), which computes _all_ prime numbers up to some number $n$ by iteratively setting elements of an array to `False` if they cannot be a prime because they are a multiple of another number.  The [pseudocode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Pseudocode) of the algorithm on the Wikipedia link above provides a pretty reasonable description of the algorithm.  As mentioned above, this particular function has nothing to do with machine learning or the rest of the course, but it is a nice demonstration of an algorithm to implement in Python, that is a good test of your general basic proficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using this pseudocode as a reference point (but note that you _don't_ have to follow it exactly), plus the function signature below (which you _do_ need to follow exactly), implement a method for computing primes using this method.  Note that even though the algorithm computes a binary array of which numbers are prime, the function as defined below needs to return a list of just the prime numbers, so you'll need to convert to that format.\n",
