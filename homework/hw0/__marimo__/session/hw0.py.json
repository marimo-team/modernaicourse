Instead, this is a basic assignment meant to test two things:</span>\n<ol>\n<li>Getting set up with our mugrade autograding systems, and</li>\n<li>Evaluating some basic background in programming and math proficiency, of the kind you'll be expected to need for this course.</li>\n</ol>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">If you can complete this assignment relatively easily, it is a good sign that your background will be sufficient for the course.  If the assignment is particularly challenging, then this might be a good indication that you would benefit from additional background before taking the course.  It's definitely not impossible to take the course while simultaneously building up this background, but it's likely going to be quite a bit harder.</span></span>"

Most autograding systems work by uploading your code and running it on the grading server; this ensures that your code runs independently and functions as desired, but has the notable downside that, for complex assignments, it can be difficult to ensure that the environment of the autograder is sufficiently similar to your own environment.  Countless hours have been wasted by students trying to trace the exact way in which the autograding environment differs from their own.  This is especially a problem for machine learning assignments where GPUs are required to run the code, and we know of very few systems that handle this setup in a seamless fashion.</span>\n\n<span class=\"paragraph\">\nThis has led us to develop mugrade, which takes the different philosophy, runs\nall the autograding code _on your local system_ (or on molab), and then just\nsends the _answer_ to mugrade to check against a reference solution.  The upside\nis that we can support large courses with relatively little overhead.  The\ndownside is that it does allow cheating of some type: you absolutely could\ncompute the solutions manually for each mugrade test case and then submit those\nanswers to get full points.  And this would almost certainly be more\ntime-consuming than just solving the problem to begin with.  So in a world where\nmost assignments can be solved by AI anyway, it seems a very reasonable\ntrade-off to give a bit more control to students of their coding environment, at\nthe cost of possibly introducing slightly more ability to game the system.  This\nis why, as a final measure, we ask for all students to upload a copy of their\nassignment, so TA's can check it as needed.\n</span>\n\n</details></span>"

You will specifically do this using a method called the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sieve of Eratosthenes</a>, which computes <em>all</em> prime numbers up to some number <marimo-tex class=\"arithmatex\">||(n||)</marimo-tex> by iteratively setting elements of an array to <code>False</code> if they cannot be a prime because they are a multiple of another number.  The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Pseudocode\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">pseudocode</a> of the algorithm on the Wikipedia link above provides a pretty reasonable description of the algorithm.  As mentioned above, this particular function has nothing to do with machine learning or the rest of the course, but it is a nice demonstration of an algorithm to implement in Python, that is a good test of your general basic proficiency.</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">Using this pseudocode as a reference point (but note that you <em>don't</em> have to follow it exactly), plus the function signature below (which you <em>do</em> need to follow exactly), implement a method for computing primes using this method.  Note that even though the algorithm computes a binary array of which numbers are prime, the function as defined below needs to return a list of just the prime numbers, so you'll need to convert to that format.</span>\n<span class=\"paragraph\">For this function, you'll want to first run the <code>@mugrade.local_tests</code> test cases, then change this to <code>@mugrade.submit</code> once you have finished and debugged your implementation.</span></span>"
